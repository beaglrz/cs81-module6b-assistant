REFLECTION

1. **What made your assistant “personal” to you?**
My assistant felt personal because I used real tasks from my daily life, like doing laundry, making lunch, and going to the gym. These are things I really do during the week, so they made the assistant feel more real instead of just general. Seeing those tasks finished in the program showed how I handle my daily chores.

2. **What challenges did you face using this?**
At first, I wasn’t entirely sure what the 'this'(what is doing the action) keyword referred to inside the method (action). After testing the code, I realized that ‘this' represents the assistant object calling the method, which helped me understand how the same methods update the correct tasks and mood.

3. **Which method would you improve or expand?**
I would expand the ‘completeTask()' method to handle completing tasks one at a time with clearer output between each task. I wanted it to feel like the program was moving step by step rather than everything happening at once.
